# 🍻 HiteJinro Inspired Project  
### **UI/UX Redesign & Frontend Implementation (Personal Practice Project)**

A desktop‑focused redesign practice project inspired by the HiteJinro website.  
I analyzed the original site’s information structure and visual flow, then rebuilt the entire page with a clearer layout and more intuitive interactions.  
All UI/UX design and frontend development were completed independently as a personal learning project.

## 📌 **Overview**
This project was created to improve the complex information hierarchy and heavy visual elements of the original website.  
While maintaining the brand’s visual tone, I redesigned the layout and interactions to make the browsing experience more intuitive and user‑friendly.
